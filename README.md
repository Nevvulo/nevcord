## Nevcord
Nevcord is a Discord client modification that stems from [aethcord created by Aetheryx](https://github.com/Aetheryx/aethcord). A lot of the code (including injectors, plugin handling and classes) were made by him, any modifications of code made by me are simply things that I personally wanted to add to tailor it more to me.
Big thank you to [Aetheryx](https://github.com/Aetheryx) for making his project open source for the community to use and helping me get everything working!

# Powercord
Powercord is a lightweight client mod focused on simplicity and performance.  
As of right now, Powercord is in *very* early stages of development, so feel free to join [this server](https://discord.gg/Yphr6WG) for any questions.

# Features
## Spotify Modal
The spotify modal you find on top of the user bar aims to replace the need for having your Spotify client on a monitor.    
You can see a video preview of the modal [here](https://discord.coffee/e2e981.mp4).

## Codeblocks
Codeblocks have line numbers (attribution: [noodlebox](https://github.com/noodlebox)) and a `copy` button.
You can see an image preview of the codeblocks [here](https://discord.coffee/cf1cf8.png).

# Requirements
  1. `npm`
  2. `node` (v10 or higher)
  2. Discord Canary
  3. Windows or Linux (I don't have a macOS machine)

# Installation steps
  1. `git clone https://github.com/aetheryx/powercord`
  2. `cd powercord`
  3. `npm i`
  4. `npm run inject` <sup>(Side note: if you're on Linux, you need root perms for this command)</sup>
  5. Completely kill your Discord Client (right click system tray icon -> Quit DiscordCanary)
  6. Start Discord back up and Powercord should be injected!  
     Make sure to view the [Powercord Wiki](https://github.com/aetheryx/powercord/wiki) for information on getting started and how Powercord works.
